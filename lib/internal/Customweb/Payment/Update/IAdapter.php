 *   <li>A manual update triggered by the merchant.</li>
 *   <li>The transaction is marked for updating. See Customweb_Payment_Authorization_ITransaction::getUpdateExecutionDate()</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * For both use cases this adapter is invoked. To work with this adapter 
 * the feature 'Update' must be supported. The adapter must appear in the 
 * container.
 * 
 * Any other kind of update triggered by external entities has to be
 * realized by endpoints.
