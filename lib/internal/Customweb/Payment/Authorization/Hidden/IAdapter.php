/**
 * The hidden authorization is a way to process a payment by adding a form to the shop,
 * where the customer enters the credentials. The action of the form is set to a URL
 * of the payment service provider. 
 * 
 * This allows the entering of the credit card details in the web shop and a processing
 * on the payment service provider, which is PCI-DSS compliant. 
 * 
 * However this integration requires a step where a form can be submitted in the checkout
 * process of the shopping cart. 
 *        		  	  	 			   
 * Additionally some payment service provider requires the processing of 3D secure transactions
 * in a separte step.
