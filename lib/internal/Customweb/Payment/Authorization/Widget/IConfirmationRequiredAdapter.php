/**
 * This adapter should be implemented by any widget authorization adapter in which the html generated can cause an automatic redirect.
 * Some shop systems may display the widget before showing a confirmation button. In this case, the widget must not be automatically submitted.
 * Any class implementing this interface should ensure that the HTML returned by the method getWidgetConfirmationHTML requires user
 * interaction to proceed.
 *
 * Example:
 * Shop system shows alias manager on the same page as the widget, without a confirmation button. The widget automatically submits itself with the
 * preseleceted alias.
 * The customer has now never confirmed the payment, and was unable to select the alias.
 * Due to this, there should be user interaction required to confirm the payment in the given widget html.
