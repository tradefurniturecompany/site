/**
 * This interface defines the methods available for the interaction with a payment
 * page implementation.
 *
 * The payment page is the simplest possible payment integration type. The customer
 * is redirected to the payment service provider. The payment service provider
 * collects the credentials in a PCI-DSS compliant environment.
 *
 * The redirection of the customer can be done in two ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>By using the Customweb_Payment_Authorization_PaymentPage_IAdapter::getRedirectionUrl() and a
 *   redirection with a HTTP header or</li>
 *   <li>by adding a form with the Customweb_Payment_Authorization_PaymentPage_IAdapter::getFormActionUrl()
 *   as the form action and with a set of hidden fields from the method
 *   Customweb_Payment_Authorization_PaymentPage_IAdapter::getParameters().</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The client of this adapter must follow the following steps:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Show the form producible by self::getVisibleFormFields(). The target of this form must be the shop server.</li>
 *   <li>Collect the data sent by the customer.</li>
 *   <li>Decide which redirection method is appropriate. Use therefore the method self::isHeaderRedirectionSupported().</li>
 *   <li>Redirect the customer by the selected redireciton method.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The implementor of this interface has to make sure, that the class is imutable.
